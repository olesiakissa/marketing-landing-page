### What I learned
By building this project I have:
- Refreshed and strengthened my knowledge of working with React Hooks (particularly with useState and useEffect)
- Discovered a lot of Tailwind utility classes which facilitate the development of modern-looking components
- Got myself acquainted with the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) frontend building tool and I can highly recommend usint it since it really decreases the build time and the facility of tailoring the project
